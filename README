# Predicting House Prices Using Regression Models

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices using regression models, specifically Linear Regression, implemented in Python. The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset from the `sklearn` library, but you can replace it with your own dataset.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python script in your preferred IDE or editor.
3. Ensure the necessary libraries are installed.
4. Run the script to train the Linear Regression model and make predictions on house prices.

## Code Structure

### 1. Load Dataset
The code uses the Boston Housing dataset from `sklearn`. Replace it with your dataset if needed.

### 2. Data Exploration
Data visualization is performed using Seaborn to understand the relationships between variables.

### 3. Data Preparation
The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y), and then further divided into training and testing sets.

### 4. Model Training
A Linear Regression model is trained using the training data.

### 5. Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.

### 6. Visualization
A scatter plot is generated to compare actual vs predicted house prices.

## Expected Output

- Metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
- A scatter plot visualizing the actual vs predicted house prices.

## Customization

- Replace the Boston Housing dataset with your own dataset.
- Experiment with other regression models like `Ridge`, `Lasso`, or `RandomForestRegressor`.
- Add more preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, scaling, etc.) if using a different dataset.

## Example Command to Run
```bash
python house_price_prediction.py
```
