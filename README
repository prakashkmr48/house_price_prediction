# Predicting House Prices Using Regression Models

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices using regression models, specifically Linear Regression, implemented in Python. The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset from the `sklearn` library, but you can replace it with your own dataset.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `streamlit`

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn streamlit
```

## How to Run the Code on Streamlit

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new Python file, for example, `app.py`, and copy the provided code into it.
3. Ensure the necessary libraries are installed.
4. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
5. Open the provided local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser to interact with the app.

## Code Structure

### 1. Load Dataset
The code uses the Boston Housing dataset from `sklearn`. Replace it with your dataset if needed.

### 2. Data Exploration
Data visualization is performed using Seaborn to understand the relationships between variables.

### 3. Data Preparation
The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y), and then further divided into training and testing sets.

### 4. Model Training
A Linear Regression model is trained using the training data.

### 5. Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.

### 6. Visualization
A scatter plot is generated to compare actual vs predicted house prices.

### 7. Streamlit Integration
The code includes an interactive Streamlit app that:
- Allows users to upload a custom dataset.
- Displays data statistics and visualizations.
- Trains a Linear Regression model and displays evaluation metrics.

## Expected Output

- Metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R² score.
- Interactive visualizations and results on the Streamlit app.

## Customization

- Replace the Boston Housing dataset with your own dataset.
- Experiment with other regression models like `Ridge`, `Lasso`, or `RandomForestRegressor`.
- Add more preprocessing steps (e.g., handling missing values, scaling, etc.) if using a different dataset.

## Example Command to Run
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
